# Time-Series-Forecasting-Keras

This project has as objective, Predict an Outcome, using an
Algorithm of Deep Learning:
• The Algorithm of Deep Learning used is a Recurrent Neural Network or RNN-LSTM
• This Algorithm is supposed to be developed in Python using Keras/TensorFlow and its
  depedencies.
• The Deep Learning Algorithm or RNN, uses a Dataset in order to make Prediction. 
  It´s Learning is developed/performed under Supervised Learning.
• The Dataset consists of a Time Series and Variables: overtime, several Variables are
  sorted to the Algorithm and upon Analisys of these Variables; an outcome should be
  Predicted by the Algorithm.
